# Covid-19-Analysis-Python
 
This Python notebook contains analysis based on Covid-19 Dataset. The dataset was imported using pandas into a DataFrame. Once imported, the null values within the dataset were imputed for the Province Column. 
Using the scipy library, the Z-Score was calculated for the Recovered Column, and using numpy and pandas bin values were created. Using panadas, the maximum number of confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases of Covid-19 country wise was determined. 
Finally, using matplotlib, a line graph was created to visualize the total deaths, confirmed, recovered, and active cases of Covid-19 country wise.
